## Useful Resources

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
- [MCP Official Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — Spec, tutorials, and guides
- [MCP-UI](https://mcpui.dev/) — Official standard for interactive UI in MCP
- [MCP Auth Guide (Auth0)](https://auth0.com/blog/mcp-specs-update-all-about-auth/) — Deep dive into MCP auth spec updates

## Main Assignment

In this session, you will build an MCP server with OAuth authentication — a cat
shop application that exposes tools for browsing products, managing a cart, and
checking out.

The main entry point is:

```text
server.py
```

The server implementation lives in:

```text
app/
```

Available MCP tools:

- `list_products`
- `get_product`
- `add_to_cart`
- `view_cart`
- `remove_from_cart`
- `checkout`

## Setup

From this folder:

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the MCP Server

Run the server locally:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Expose the server with ngrok

In a separate terminal, start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the ngrok forwarding URL (e.g. `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`) and
restart the server with it:

```bash
ISSUER_URL=https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app uv run server.py
```

> **Note:** The `ISSUER_URL` must match the public URL clients use to reach the
> server, otherwise OAuth authentication will fail.

## Outline

### Breakout Room #1

- Set up the MCP server with OAuth and the product database
- Explore the MCP tools: `list_products`, `get_product`, `add_to_cart`, `view_cart`, `remove_from_cart`, `checkout`

### Breakout Room #2

- Connect an MCP client to the server
- Build an end-to-end interaction flow using the MCP tools

## Ship

The completed MCP server and client integration!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the MCP server you built and a demo of the client interacting with it; or
  - the notebook you created for the Advanced Build

## Share

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

Here's a template to get you started:

## Submitting Your Homework 

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:

1. Review the MCP server code in `server.py` and the `app/` directory
2. Run the MCP server locally using `uv run server.py`
3. Connect to the server using an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, or a custom client)
4. Test all available tools: browsing products, adding to cart, viewing cart, removing items, and checkout
5. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session

## Questions

### Question #1

Why is OAuth important for MCP servers, and what security considerations should you keep in mind when exposing tools to AI clients?

#### Answer

_(insert your answer here)_

### Question #2

What is Streamable HTTP transport in MCP, and why might you expose a server publicly with OAuth instead of using a local stdio connection?

#### Answer

_(insert your answer here)_

## Activity 1: Extend the MCP Server

Add at least one new tool to the cat shop MCP server (e.g., `search_products`, `update_cart_quantity`, or `get_order_history`). Ensure the new tool integrates properly with the existing database and OAuth authentication. Demo the new tool through an MCP client and include it in your Loom video.

## Advanced Activity: Build a Custom MCP Client

Build a custom MCP client that connects to the cat shop server over Streamable HTTP, authenticates via OAuth, and orchestrates a multi-step shopping flow (browse → add to cart → checkout). Compare the developer experience of MCP-based tool integration vs. traditional REST API calls.

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.
