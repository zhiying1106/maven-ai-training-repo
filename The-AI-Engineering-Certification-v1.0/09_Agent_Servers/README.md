## What You Are Building

In earlier sessions, you built LangGraph agents in notebooks. In this session, you take that agent to production in two parts:

1. **Deploy the agent** as an API backend on LangSmith (via LangGraph Studio and `langgraph deploy`)
2. **Build a website** that talks to that agent, then **deploy the site on Vercel**

```mermaid

  Vercel -->|"/api proxy route"| LangSmith[LangSmith Agent API]
  LangSmith --> Agent[Your LangGraph agent]
  Agent --> Tools[Tools + RAG + memory]
  LangSmith --> Traces[LangSmith tracing & evals]
```

> **Important:** LangSmith deploys your agent as an **API backend only**. It does not serve a frontend. Vercel hosts the UI; LangSmith hosts the agent.

## Main Assignment

You will package a LangGraph agent into a production-ready Python project, test it in **LangGraph Studio**, deploy it to **LangSmith**, then build a **Next.js chat UI** that streams responses from your deployed agent and ship that UI to **Vercel**.

Expected agent project layout:

```text

├── langgraph.json          # Manifest — how LangGraph discovers your graphs
├── app/
│   ├── state.py            # Shared state schema

    └── app/
        ├── page.tsx
        └── api/[...path]/route.ts
```

## Prerequisites

In addition to tools from earlier sessions, you will need:

1. A [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) account
2. **Docker** installed locally (needed for `langgraph up` and some deploy paths)
3. Your agent code pushed to a **GitHub** repository (needed for LangSmith cloud deploys)
4. A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account
5. *(Optional)* **LangSmith Plus** (~$40/month) for one-click cloud deploys via `langgraph deploy`

## Quick Command Reference

Two servers run **locally** (the agent API and the frontend), and two things deploy **online** (the agent to LangSmith, the frontend to Vercel). Run commands from `09_Agent_Servers/` unless noted. The detailed walkthrough for each step is in Parts 1–4 below.

### Run locally

**1. Agent server (LangGraph) — terminal 1**

```bash
uv sync                            # install Python deps (first time only)
cp .env.example .env               # then fill in OPENAI_API_KEY and TAVILY_API_KEY
uv run langgraph dev               # API at http://localhost:2024 + opens LangGraph Studio
```

**2. Frontend (Next.js) — terminal 2**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install                        # install JS deps (first time only)
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # defaults already point at http://localhost:2024
npm run dev                        # chat UI at http://localhost:3000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and chat. The browser hits the Next.js `/api` proxy, which forwards to your local agent server.

### Deploy online

**3. Agent → LangSmith** (push your repo to GitHub first; run from `09_Agent_Servers/`)

```bash
uv run langgraph deploy            # LangSmith cloud build + host (requires LangSmith Plus)
# or self-host in Docker on your own VPS instead:
uv run langgraph up
```

Then copy the **Deployment URL** and **LangSmith API key** from the LangSmith Deployments tab.

**4. Frontend → Vercel** (run from `frontend/`)

```bash
npm install -g vercel              # install the Vercel CLI (first time only)
cd frontend
vercel                             # first run links/creates the project (preview deploy)
vercel --prod                      # production deploy
```

Set these in the Vercel project (Settings → Environment Variables, or `vercel env add`), then run `vercel --prod` again:

```text
LANGGRAPH_API_URL=https://your-deployment.us.langgraph.app
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app/api
```

## Setup

From this folder, install the agent environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Typical variables:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=
TAVILY_API_KEY=
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
```

## Part 1: Run Locally and Use LangGraph Studio

Package your agent so it can be served as an API — not as a notebook cell.

### 1. Define your graphs in `langgraph.json`

Register each compiled graph and the assistants you want to expose:

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "env": ".env",
  "graphs": {
    "simple_agent": "app.graphs.simple_agent:graph"
  },
  "assistants": {
    "agent": {
      "graph_id": "simple_agent",
      "name": "Simple Agent",
      "description": "Agent with tools using conditional tool-calling."
    }
  }
}
```

Each graph file should export a compiled graph named `graph`.

### 2. Start the local agent server

```bash
uv run langgraph dev
```

This starts the agent API at `http://localhost:2024` and opens **LangGraph Studio** in your browser (Chromium-based browsers work best).

### 3. Explore and debug in Studio

Use Studio to:

- Visualize graph topology — nodes, edges, and conditional branches
- Step through execution and inspect tool calls and results
- Fork conversations to test alternate paths
- Switch between assistants defined in `langgraph.json`

Studio and the SDK stream the same events. Studio is for debugging; the SDK (and your frontend) is for production integration.

### 4. Smoke-test with the SDK

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="http://localhost:2024")

for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    None,
    "agent",
    input={"messages": [{"role": "human", "content": "How often should I deworm my cat?"}]},
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(chunk)
```

If this works locally, you are ready to deploy.

## Part 2: Deploy the Agent on LangSmith

Push your agent repo to GitHub, then deploy.

### Option A: LangSmith cloud deploy (recommended for this session)

```bash
uv run langgraph deploy
```

Requires LangSmith Plus. LangSmith builds and hosts the agent API for you. After deploy, copy your **Deployment URL** and **LangSmith API key** from the LangSmith Deployments tab — you will need both for the frontend.

Enable **auto-update on push** so every commit to your main branch triggers a redeploy.

### Option B: Self-hosted with Docker

```bash
uv run langgraph up
```

Runs a production-ready container you can host on any VPS. You manage scaling, uptime, and auth yourself.

### What you get

A hosted API endpoint with standard routes for threads, runs, and assistants. Your agent runs behind that API; LangSmith traces and monitors execution.

## Part 3: Build a Website That Uses Your Agent

Create a Next.js frontend that streams chat responses from your deployed agent.

### Recommended architecture

Never put `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` in client-side code. Use a **Next.js API route** as a secure proxy:

```text
Browser  →  /api/* on Vercel  →  LangSmith Deployment URL
              (injects API key server-side)
```

### 1. Scaffold the frontend

From this folder:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest frontend
cd frontend
npm install @langchain/react langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough
```

### 2. Add the API passthrough route

Create `frontend/app/api/[...path]/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { initApiPassthrough } from "langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough";

export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, runtime } =
  initApiPassthrough({
    apiUrl: process.env.LANGGRAPH_API_URL,
    apiKey: process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY,
    runtime: "edge",
  });
```

### 3. Build the chat UI with `useStream`

In a client component (e.g. `frontend/app/page.tsx`), connect to your local proxy or deployed passthrough:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useStream } from "@langchain/react";

export default function ChatPage() {
  const { messages, submit, isLoading } = useStream({
    apiUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ?? "/api",
    assistantId: "agent",
  });

  // Render messages and a form that calls submit({ messages: [...] })
}
```

Use the `assistantId` that matches your `langgraph.json` assistants block.

### 4. Test locally

In `frontend/.env.local`:

```text
# Point at your local agent server (uv run langgraph dev):
LANGGRAPH_API_URL=http://localhost:2024
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=

# ...or point at your deployed LangSmith agent instead:
# LANGGRAPH_API_URL=https://your-deployment.us.langgraph.app
# LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

Install deps (first time) and run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, send a message, and confirm you see streamed responses from your LangSmith deployment.

## Part 4: Deploy the Frontend on Vercel

### 1. Push the frontend to GitHub

Commit the `frontend/` directory (either in the same repo as your agent or a separate repo).

### 2. Import the project in Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import your repository
2. Set the **Root Directory** to `frontend` if the Next.js app is not at the repo root
3. Add environment variables in the Vercel project settings:

```text
LANGGRAPH_API_URL=https://your-deployment.us.langgraph.app
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app/api
```

4. Deploy

### 3. Verify end-to-end

Visit your Vercel URL, send a chat message, and confirm:

- The UI streams agent responses
- Tool calls work against your deployed agent
- Traces appear in LangSmith for each run

## Questions

### Question #1

Why does LangSmith deploy your agent as an API backend only, and why do you still need a separate frontend deployment like Vercel?

#### Answer
- LangSmith deploys your agent as an API backend, exposing endpoints that process requests and return responses, but it does not provide a user interface.
- A separate frontend platform like Vercel hosts the web application where users can interact with the agent through a browser.
- The frontend sends user requests to the LangSmith API and displays the agent's responses.
- Separating the frontend and backend makes it easier to develop, deploy, and scale each component independently.

### Question #2

Why should the LangSmith API key live in a Next.js API route (server-side) instead of in the browser?

#### Answer
- Keeping the LangSmith API key in a Next.js API route prevents it from being exposed to users in the browser.
- Server-side routes securely authenticate requests to LangSmith without revealing sensitive credentials.
- If the key were stored in the browser, anyone could inspect it and misuse it, leading to unauthorized API access or unexpected costs.
- Using a server-side API route follows security best practices by keeping secrets on the server while the frontend only communicates with your own backend.

## Activity 1: Build a Helpfulness Loop in Production

Build an `agent_with_helpfulness` graph that adds a post-response helpfulness check: after the agent answers, a judge model decides whether the response is helpful, and if not, the graph loops back for another attempt (with a safe loop limit). Register it in `langgraph.json`, deploy it, then compare LangSmith traces for queries that pass vs. fail the helpfulness check. Does the retry loop behave differently in Studio vs. production?

- In my testing, the retry loop behaved the same in both LangGraph Studio and the deployed production graph. It's possible that the answer generated in LangGraph Studio is different from deployed production due to some random state.

## Advanced Activity: Auth and Custom Routes

Research [LangSmith Deployments custom routes](https://github.com/langchain-samples/lsd-custom-route-react-ui) and describe how you could add authentication so each user only sees their own threads. Optionally implement a simple auth gate on your Vercel frontend.

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.
