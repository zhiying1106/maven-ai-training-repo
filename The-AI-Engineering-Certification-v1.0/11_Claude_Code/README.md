## Main Assignment

**Build a chat web app powered by the Claude Agent SDK** — and build it *with* Claude Code.

This session is markdown-only on purpose. There is no starter code and no notebook: every line of code in your final app will be written in collaboration with Claude Code. The session has one build arc across a single breakout room:

```text
you → Claude Code → chat app skeleton → wire in Agent SDK query()
      (FastAPI + chat UI, echo stub)      ├─ tools: Read / Glob / Grep
                                           └─ your custom tool
```

The finished product: a **codebase concierge** — a chat interface in the browser where an agent (with real tools) answers questions about any repository you point it at. In Session 10 you served models behind endpoints; today you serve an *agent* behind one.

Work through the three guides in order:

```text
01_Installing_Claude_Code.md   # install, authenticate, verify
02_Using_Claude_Code.md        # drive Claude Code; scaffold the chat app skeleton
03_Claude_Agent_SDK.md         # add the agent and connect it to your website
```

## Outline

### Breakout Room #1: Claude Code, the Agent SDK, and the Connection

- Task 1: Install Claude Code and authenticate ([guide](./01_Installing_Claude_Code.md))
- Task 2: Learn the loop — explore a repo you didn't write ([guide](./02_Using_Claude_Code.md))
- Task 3: Scaffold the chat app skeleton with Claude Code (plan → implement → verify)
- Task 4: Write the project's `CLAUDE.md`
- Question #1 and Question #2
- Task 5: Install the Agent SDK and run your first `query()` ([guide](./03_Claude_Agent_SDK.md))
- Task 6: Wire the agent into `/api/chat` — replace the echo stub
- Task 7: Conversation memory — resume sessions across messages
- Task 8: Give the agent a custom tool
- Question #3 and Question #4
- Activity #1: Level Up the Chat App

## Questions

### ❓ Question #1

While scaffolding in Task 3 you used **plan mode** before letting Claude Code write anything. Why does an agent that can execute shell commands need a permission system at all, and why is plan mode particularly valuable when starting a project from an empty directory?

#### ✅ Answer

_(insert your answer here)_

### ❓ Question #2

`CLAUDE.md` is loaded into context at the start of every session. What belongs in it — and what *doesn't*? How does this relate to what you learned about context management and memory in Session 3?

#### ✅ Answer

_(insert your answer here)_

### ❓ Question #3

The Agent SDK gives you the same agent loop that powers Claude Code. Compare this to the agent loops you hand-built with LangGraph in Sessions 2–4: what does the SDK give you for free, and what control do you give up?

#### ✅ Answer

_(insert your answer here)_

### ❓ Question #4

Your chat app could have called a chat completions API directly, the way you did early in the course. What do you gain by routing every message through the Agent SDK's `query()` instead — and what new risks does an agent with tools introduce that a plain chat completion doesn't have? How did your tool allowlist and permission mode address them?

#### ✅ Answer

_(insert your answer here)_

## Activity 1: Level Up the Chat App

Extend your working chat app with **at least one** of the following (built with Claude Code, of course):

1. **Live progress streaming** — stream the agent's activity to the browser (e.g. via Server-Sent Events) so users see tool calls ("reading `app.py`…") while the agent works, instead of a spinner
2. **Multi-conversation support** — a sidebar of separate conversations, each mapped to its own SDK session
3. **A second custom tool** — something genuinely useful for your target repo (e.g. `git_log` for recent changes, or a test-runner summary tool)

Whichever you pick, demo it in your Loom video and explain the design decision in one paragraph.

## Advanced Activity: The Cat Shop Concierge

Connect your Session 8 cat shop MCP server to your chat app's agent via the SDK's `mcp_servers` option. Your chat app becomes a shopping concierge: users can browse the catalog, fill a cart, and check out — in natural language, through the UI you built, hitting the OAuth-protected server you wrote in Session 8.

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.

## Ship 🚢

The working chat app!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom showing:
  - Claude Code scaffolding or extending the app (plan → implement → verify — show the plan!); and
  - the chat app answering real questions about a repository, including at least one visible custom-tool use

## Share 🚀

Make a social media post about your final application!

## Submitting Your Homework (Optional For Extra Mark)

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:

1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your repo:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

2. Work through `01_Installing_Claude_Code.md`, `02_Using_Claude_Code.md`, and `03_Claude_Agent_SDK.md` in order.
3. Build your chat app in a new `chat-app/` folder inside this session directory (include its `CLAUDE.md` — we want to see it!).
4. Fill in your answers to Questions #1–#4 in this README.
5. Complete Activity #1 and record your Loom video.
6. Add, commit, and push your work to your origin repository. Remove `.env` files and API keys before committing.

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub URL to your repo.
