## Main Assignment

Previous sessions built, evaluated, and served the cat health agent. Session 12 prepares it for production with three small, self-contained concepts:

```text
01 Guardrails -> control what goes into and comes out of the agent   (notebook)
02 Caching    -> stop paying for the same answer twice               (notebook)
a2a/          -> let your agent talk to other agents over a protocol (runnable mini-project)
```

Each part is deliberately short: one new concept and a handful of tasks. The parts are independent — there is no set order or outline for this session. Pick whichever interests you most, or work through all three.

## The Parts

**`01_Cat_Health_Agent_Guardrails.ipynb`** — Build layered guardrails around the agent: deterministic input rails (emergency escalation, injection blocking, PII redaction), a model-based topical guard, and output rails that check and repair draft replies, wired into the agent loop with LangChain middleware.

**`02_Cat_Health_Agent_Caching.ipynb`** — Stop paying for repeated work: exact-match response caching, a from-scratch semantic cache (and why it is dangerous in a health domain), embedding and tool-result caches, and provider-side prompt caching you can measure in the usage details.

**`a2a/`** — Build the A2A protocol from the wire up: a specialist agent behind a minimal A2A server (`server.py`), a discovery-driven client (`client.py`), and a front-desk agent that delegates across the protocol (`front_desk.py`). Start with [`a2a/README.md`](a2a/README.md) — it walks through starting the server and testing it with curl, the client, the delegation demo, and a no-API-key smoke test.

## Setup

From this folder, install the environment with uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then open the notebooks in Cursor or VS Code and select the Python/Jupyter environment created by uv.

You will need an OpenAI API key available when running the notebooks:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Optional LangSmith tracing:

```bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-key"
```

The `a2a/` mini-project starts a local HTTP server on port 9999. Nothing leaves your machine; stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

## Questions

### ❓ Question #1

In `01_Cat_Health_Agent_Guardrails.ipynb`, input rails run in a specific order: deterministic checks (emergency, injection, PII) first, then the model-based topical guard. Why is that ordering important in production — and why do the rails return decisions like `escalate`, `block`, and `rewrite` instead of a simple boolean pass/fail?

### ❓ Question #2

In `02_Cat_Health_Agent_Caching.ipynb`, a semantic cache can serve a paraphrased FAQ for the price of one embedding call — but the notebook also shows how a one-word difference (treat vs. poison) can produce a catastrophic cache hit. Why can't you fix this with a better similarity threshold alone, and what should a production health agent do instead for high-stakes queries?

## Submitting Your Homework

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:

1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your AIE9 repo:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

1. Start Cursor from the `12_Production_Agent_Patterns` folder.
2. Work through the parts you chose (notebooks and/or the `a2a/` mini-project).
3. Keep useful outputs that help explain your work — for example guardrail decision tables, cache hit/miss timings, or the A2A delegation trace. Remove secrets and excessively noisy outputs.
4. Add, commit, and push your modified work to your origin repository.

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub URL to your AIE9 repo.
