## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to. These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms.

- 🏗️ **Activities** - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** - Take on a challenge. These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation.

## Main Assignment

In this assignment, you will build a vector RAG application using LangChain v1, OpenAI embeddings, and Qdrant.

The main notebook is:

```text
01_Cat_Health_Vector_RAG_LangChain_Qdrant.ipynb
```

The notebook uses the bundled cat health guideline PDF in `data/cat_health_guidelines.pdf`.

### Setup

From this folder, install the environment with uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then open the notebook in Cursor or VS Code and select the Python/Jupyter environment created by uv.

You will also need an OpenAI API key available when running the notebook.

## 🏗️ Activity #1: Embedding Similarity

Run the embedding similarity primer in the notebook.

You will compare embeddings for terms like:

- `king`
- `queen`
- `banana`
- `cat`
- `veterinarian`
- `cat health guidelines`

#### ❓Question #1

Why is cosine similarity useful for dense vector retrieval?

##### ✅ Answer:

---

## 🏗️ Activity #2: Build the Vector RAG Pipeline

Run the notebook sections that:

1. Load the PDF into LangChain `Document` objects
2. Split the document into chunks
3. Embed the chunks
4. Store the chunk embeddings in in-memory Qdrant
5. Retrieve relevant chunks with similarity scores
6. Generate an answer grounded in retrieved context

#### ❓Question #2

Why is metadata important for a RAG application?

##### ✅ Answer:

#### ❓Question #3

What tradeoff do we make when choosing chunk size and chunk overlap?

##### ✅ Answer:

#### ❓Question #4

What does a similarity score help you understand, and what does it not prove by itself?

##### ✅ Answer:

---

## 🏗️ Activity #3: Vibe Check Retrieval Quality

Run the notebook's vibe check queries and inspect both:

- The retrieved context
- The generated answer

#### ❓Question #5

For the vibe check queries, did the retrieved context seem relevant before generation? Why or why not?

##### ✅ Answer:

---

## 🏗️ Activity #4: Tune Retrieval

Improve retrieval quality by changing one or more of:

- Chunk size
- Chunk overlap
- Retrieval `k`
- Query wording

Document what changed and whether retrieval improved.

##### Settings Changed:

-

##### Results:

1.
2.
3.

## Optional Deep Dive: RAG From Scratch

If you want to look underneath the library abstractions, run the optional reference notebook:

```text
02_Cat_Health_Vector_RAG_From_Scratch.ipynb
```

It builds the same retrieval pipeline again with only:

- `pypdf` for extracting text from the PDF
- Python standard-library HTTP requests for calling OpenAI
- Handcrafted document, chunking, embedding, similarity-search, vector-store, and generation primitives

This notebook is a reference walkthrough, not an additional assignment. Its purpose is to make the responsibilities hidden by LangChain, Qdrant, and provider SDKs visible.

## Submitting Your Homework

### Main Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:

1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your AIE9 repo:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

2. Start Cursor from the `01_Dense_Vector_Retrieval` folder.
3. Complete the notebook.
4. Answer the questions in this `README.md`.
5. Add, commit, and push your modified work to your origin repository.

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub URL to your AIE9 repo.
